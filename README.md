# Lyric Sync
 
Tired of Spotify's boring and outdated lyrics? Lyric Sync will help sync music beautifully! This is a simple tool that allows you to sync any song beat by beat (as Apple calls it) 
### Why?
When I first found the [beautiful lyrics](https://github.com/surfbryce/beautiful-lyrics/tree/main) spicetify extension, it completely changed my music listening experience. I never thought lyrics could be expressed in such an engaging way. I instantly wanted to figure out how it worked, and more importantly, how I could sync songs that didn't hvae it yet. I unfortunately learned that it was using data from Apple Music, which uses an AI. That mean I can't do it myself, and if a song doesn't have beat by beat sync, it probably never will

# The Ultimate Goal
Spotify's lyrics are boring and outdated. It's 2024, we should have more than just line by line lyrics. If Spotify isn't going to fix it, then let's do it ourselves (MusixMatch has a word by word sync, Spotify just doesn't use it. Although, MusixMatch's word by word is not great...). I have big plans for this project, so stay tuned

# Contributing
Want to help my vision of a world with better lyrics? I could use help with just about anything, so it's pretty much an open book. You can look at the roadmap and see if you could do anything there. Along with the programming side, I could use a better UI if you're good with UX design. Submit a pull request and it'll probably get merged
